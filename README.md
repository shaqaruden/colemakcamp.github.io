# Colemak Camp
A fork of Colemak Club that overhauls the entire experience. Brings support for custom themes and a wider range of display sizes.

It is hosted on this repo's [Github Pages](https://colemakcamp.github.io/).

Note that this project is a fork of [Colemak Club](https://github.com/gnusenpai/colemakclub), which itself is a fork of [Colemak Academy](https://colemak.academy/).

## Key Features

- Responsive design, fits in more display sizes.
- Customizable theme colors, including light and dark modes.
- Several more menu options are now saved in local storage, thus remembered if you refresh.
- Cheatsheet keyboard is sized more accurately.
- Custom input keyboard changes according to selected keyboard type.
- Overall change in the design language.
- Persistent custom layout via local storage.
- Support for phones and tablets running Android (and iOS hopefully).

### Planned Features
- Custom themes.
- Sharing and loading custom themes via links.

## Build Tools
This project does not rely on npm or other similar tools. You may utilize any toolchain you want as long as you can reproduce same results.

- Install VS Code
- Install extensions:
    - [Nu-Minify](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emapco.nu-minify)
    - [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glenn2223.live-sass)
    - [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
- Update VS Code settings:
``` json
{
    "minify.js": {
        "output": {
            "comments": "/^!/"
        }
    },
    "minify.minifyExistingOnSave": true,
    "liveSassCompile.settings.useNewCompiler": true,
    "liveServer.settings.donotShowInfoMsg": true
}
```

- Watch Sass
    - You will need to click 'Watch Sass' to compile `scss` files to `css`. Once clicked, all changes will be automatically compiled within that session. Note that this does not minify anything.
- Minify on Save
    - Using the settings above will enable this feature; otherwise enable it manually from extension settings.
    - If the file you're minifying already has an existing `.min` file, simply saving the source will update the minified file. So, you need to save the `main.css` file to update the `main.min.css` file.
    - If there is no existing `.min` file, run the `Minify` command on the source file. (Press F1 to search available commands, `>minify`.)
